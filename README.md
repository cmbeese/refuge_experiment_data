Description of files (alphabetical):

CSVs:

add_vars.csv - 100 test profiles to simulate adding up 100% refuge at each size class to a flat (non-complex) reef

multi_groups - groups assigned to 500 test profiles based on results and rules laid out in manuscript

multi_res.csv - results of the trials from multi_vars profiles

multi_vars.csv - 500 test profiles for systematic testing of characteristics of reef refuge

null_vars.csv - test profiles for a run for a flat reef and all unaltered mechanically disturbed and bleached test reefs, for comparison

sela_profiles.csv - mean, median, mode, maximum, and minimum availability of refuge (percentage) for each bin 
                 empirically derived from Selayar data and (2018) refuge function
